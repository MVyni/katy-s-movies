                <p>After moving to an old apartment, a young artist starts to notice strange behaviors in her mirror, which seems to show a parallel reality. Attracted by disturbing visions of a different life, she discovers that the mirror is a door to a nightmare world, where her own insecurities and fears come to life. As the boundaries between the two worlds fade, she is chased by a dark version of herself, who wants to take her place. To save her sanity and her life, she needs to uncover the dark past of the mirror before it is too late.</p>
